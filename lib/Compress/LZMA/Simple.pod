=head1 NAME

A simple utility of LZMA compression/decompression


=head1 SYNOPSYS

 use Compress::LZMA::Simple;
 my $original = "LZMA stands for Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain-Algorithm.";
 my $compressed = Compress::LZMA::Simple::compress(\$original);
 my $decompressed = Compress::LZMA::Simple::decompress($compressed);
 printf("%s\n", $$decompressed);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain-Algorithm (LZMA) is an data compression algorithm.  It compresses very well (better than gzip and bzip2), compresses very slowly (much slower than bzip2) but decompresses relatively quickly.

This module is a Perl interface of "lzmalib", which is a tiny wrapper of the LZMA SDK.  "lzmalib" can be downloaded at http://tokyocabinet.sourceforge.net/misc/ .

The functions "compress" and "decompress" accept both of scalar and reference as the parameter.  If a scalar is given, the function returns a scalar.  If a reference is given, the function returns a reference.
